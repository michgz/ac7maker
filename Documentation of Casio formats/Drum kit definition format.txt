Category 6 contains drum wavetable decoder. This decodes MIDI notes & velocities
to sounds.

Memory 0 is the built-in drum kits (plus two unused ones).
Memory 1 supports 1 parameter set. It seems to be never used.
Memory 3 supports 5 parameter sets. They are used as follows:
    0 Current Upper 1 drum kit
    1 Current Upper 2 drum kit
    2 Current Lower 1 drum kit
    3 Current Lower 2 drum kit
    4 Seems never used


Rhythms can also use modified drum kits (with per-sound filtering, sound substitutions
etc.). I haven't found where those are stored.



HBR
---

Repeating blocks of 174 (0xAE) bytes. The block repeats 128 times, corresponding
to the 128 MIDI notes.


Parameter-based
---------------

The same information is stored in parameters 0-60. Blocks are assigned as follows:


All parameters: indexed by Block0 taking values 0-127, corresponding to the 128
                    MIDI notes.
                    
                    
Parameters 16-17: indexed by Block1 taking values 0-2.
Parameters 29-34: indexed by Block1 taking values 0-15, corresponding to up to
                    16 different sounds that can be performed from this note.
                    Multiple notes can be used to achieve stereo and/or velocity
                    layering.
Parameters 35-40: indexed by Block1 taking values 0-1, corresponding to up to 2
                    EQ filters that can be assigned to the note.
All other parameters: not indexed by Block1.


Parameter lengths: all 1 (i.e. up to 12 bits. Most are 7- or 8-bit values)


Some parameter meanings:

6:  overall volume
9:  overall volume
12: reverb send
16-17: pitch-shifting portamento

The following are per-sound parameters:
--
29: index into wavetable
30: minimum MIDI velocity that results in this sound
31: maximum MIDI velocity that results in this sound
32: volume (maximum value 0x80)
33: balance/pan (0-0x7F)
35-40: EQ filtering. Same as Tone (category 3) parameters 117-122.



Secret kits
-----------

Memory 0 parameter sets 37 & 38 aren't assigned to any tones. 37 is just a voice
counting "One" through "Five" in English & Japanese. 38 is very similar to StdKit1
(almost all the same sounds in the central part of the keyboard).
