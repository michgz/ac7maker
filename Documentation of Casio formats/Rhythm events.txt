A rhythm event consists of 3 bytes:

<byte 1> Time delta in ticks; 96 ticks per crotchet
<byte 2> Event type
<byte 3> Event data

The known event types are:


0-127:  note on/note off. Event data = velocity of note on (if non-zero), or note off (if zero)

0x8E pitch bend
0xA0 (causes software failure - don't use!)
0xA9 reset parameters to default
0xB0 Modulation (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x01)
0xB5 Expression (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x0B)
0xB9 Pitch bend range
0xBA Filter resonance (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x4A)
0xBB Filter (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x47)
0xBC Attack time (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x49)
0xBD Release time (equivalent to MIDI CC 0x48)
0xE0 affects inversion/chord conversion
0xE1 affects inversion/chord conversion
0xE3 Tempo fast (event data 0x00 = normal, 0x7F = twice normal tempo, 0xFF = even faster)
0xE4 Tempo slow (event data 0x00 = normal, 0x7F = half normal tempo, 0xFF = even slower)
0xE6 affects inversion/chord conversion
0xFC End of track
0xFF Time jump. Event data = time delta MSByte
