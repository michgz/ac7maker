Introduction
============

The following is a documentation of the AiX-specific (or possibly CTX-specific)
atoms found in the ELMT blocks within an AC7 rhythm file. The atom types for
these lie in the range 30h - 3Fh.

This may not be a complete summary, it is just the ones that I've found so far.


30h : Delay sends
=================

Location:           Before FDh atom
Payload length:     8
Usage:              Defines delay send values for each part.
Atom structure:     30h     Atom type
                    8       Payload length
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 1. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 2. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 3. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 4. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 5. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 6. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 7. Possible values: 0 - 127
                    <byte>  Delay send for part 8. Possible values: 0 - 127


31h : Drum sound substitution
=============================

Location:           After FEh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     6
Usage:              Substitutes an individual drum sound from a patch other than
                    the one selected in the mixer. Both the patch containing the
                    substituted sound and the selected patch for the part must
                    be drum patches.
Atom structure:     31h     Atom type
                    6       Payload length
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to apply the
                            substitution to. Since it must have a drum patch
                            selected, in practise it will only ever be value 8
                            or 9 (i.e. part 1 or part 2).
                    <byte>  MIDI note number to apply the subsitution to. Possible
                            values 0 - 127.
                    <byte>  "bank_msb" value for the patch which contains the
                            substituted sound. Always 120.
                    <byte>  Possibly an index. Usually 0.
                    <byte>  "patch" value for the patch which contains the
                            substituted sound. Possible values 0 - 127.
                    <byte>  MIDI note number of the substituted sound. Possible
                            values: 0 - 127


32h : Drum sound effects
========================

Location:           After FEh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     4
Usage:              Applies an effect to an individual drum sound. The effects
                    are similar to those controlled by "MIDI CC" controllers,
                    except applied to only one sound from the channel rather
                    than the whole channel. The selected patch for the part must
                    be a drum patch.
Atom structure:     32h     Atom type
                    4       Payload length
                    <byte>  Effect to apply. Possible values 0 - 11. Some of the
                            effects are:
                                2   Fine tuning
                                5   Attack time
                                9   Volume
                                10  Pan
                                11  Expression
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to apply the effect
                            to. Since it must have a drum patch selected, in
                            practise it will only ever be value 8 or 9 (i.e. part
                            1 or part 2).
                    <byte>  MIDI note number to apply the effect to. Possible
                            values 0 - 127.
                    <byte>  Value of the effect. Possible values 0 - 127.


33h : Drum sound EQ
===================

Location:           After FEh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     7
Usage:              Applies equalisation to an individual drum sound. The selected
                    patch for the part must be a drum patch.
Atom structure:     33h     Atom type
                    7       Payload length
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to apply the
                            equalisation to. Since it must have a drum patch
                            selected, in practise it will only ever be value 8
                            or 9 (i.e. part 1 or part 2).
                    <byte>  MIDI note number to apply the equalisation to.
                            Possible values 0 - 127.
                    <byte>  Possibly an index. Usually 0.
                    <byte>  Specifies the EQ type. Some possible values:
                                0   Low-pass filter
                                2   High-pass filter
                    <byte>  Parameter 1. Often frequency
                    <byte>  Parameter 2. Often unused (set to 64)
                    <byte>  Parameter 3. Often unused (set to 0)


35h : Melody sound EQ
=====================

Location:           After FEh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     6
Usage:              Applies equalisation to a melody (i.e. non-drum) part. The
                    selected patch for the part must not be a drum patch.
Atom structure:     35h     Atom type
                    6       Payload length
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to apply the
                            equalisation to. Possible values 8 - 15.
                    <byte>  Possibly an index. Usually 0.
                    <byte>  Specifies the EQ type. Possible values 0 - 7. Some
                            of the available types are:
                                0   Bass boost
                                1   Bass shelf filter
                                2   Band pass filter
                                5   Notch filter
                                6   Notch filter
                                7   Treble shelf filter
                    <byte>  Parameter 1. Possible values 0 -127. Often frequency
                            (see Note 1).
                    <byte>  Parameter 2. Possible values 0 - 127. Often cut/boost
                            (see Note 2).
                    <byte>  Parameter 3. Possible values 0 - 15.

Note 1: when Parameter 1 is used to represent frequency (e.g. roll-off frequency,
center frequency, etc., depending on the type of EQ) then the specified value x
is related to the frequency f in Hz by a power law relation:

    x = 127 * (f / 10000Hz) ^ 3.14      [TODO: verify this!]

Note 2: when Parameter 2 is used to represent cut/boost, then the relation is
approximately as follows:

    x = 0: cut -12.7dB
    x = 64: no cut/boost
    x = 127: boost +12.7dB


36h : DSP chain definition
==========================

Adds/removes a DSP chain to a certain part. The payload can take one of three
different forms:


Location:           After FDh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     4
Usage:              Clears the DSP chain for the channel, for example if the patch
                    selected for the part has its own DSP definition. Possibly
                    optional?
Atom structure:     36h     Atom type
                    4       Payload length
                    <byte>  Always 0.
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to remove the DSP
                            chain from. Possible values 8 - 15.
                    <byte>  Always 0.
                    <byte>  Always 0.


Location:           After FDh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     4
Usage:              Adds an effect to a DSP chain.
Atom structure:     36h     Atom type
                    4       Payload length
                    <byte>  Always 0.
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to add the DSP effect
                            to. Possible values 8 - 15.
                    <byte>  Position in the DSP chain to add the effect to.
                            Possible values 0 - 3.
                    <byte>  Effect type. Possible values 1 - 31. The values used
                            here are the same as used in the .TON tone definition
                            files.


Location:           After FDh atom (multiple instances allowed)
Payload length:     6
Usage:              Changes an effect parameter within a DSP chain.
Atom structure:     36h     Atom type
                    6       Payload length
                    <byte>  Always 1.
                    <byte>  MIDI channel number of the part to make the change
                            to. Possible values 8 - 15.
                    <byte>  Position in the DSP chain of the effect which is to
                            be changed. Possible values 0 - 3.
                    <byte>  Effect type of the effect which is to be changed.
                            Possible values 1 - 31 (see above).
                    <byte>  Number of the parameter to be changed. Possible
                            values 0 - 13. This uses the same ordering as the
                            parameter list given in consumer documentation,
                            starting with 0 as the first parameter and ending
                            with "WetLevel" and "DryLevel" (see Note 3).
                    <byte>  Value of the parameter. Possible values 0 - 127.


Note 3: the exception is Delay (effect type 19), where parameter number 0 has no
effect (in consumer documentation, the first parameter is "Time"), and two extra
parameters are added after "WetLevel" and "DryLevel":

    Parameter 12: Time (100's). Possible values 0 - 10.
    Parameter 13: Time (1's). Possible values 0 - 99.
